# K-Nearest-Neighbor

K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is an algorithm that has been widely used in Classification Rule Mining (CRM). KNN uses a training data to classify new data based on its similarity with training data (Larose & Larose, 2015). KNN has been widely used to classify big data, such as satellite images and electrocardiogram patterns classification (Hastie et al., 2009).
